# Horiseon Marketing Refactored 

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT HTML and CSS code applied to the website so it can be user friendly
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./assets/image-reference/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)


## Installation

In the HTML, some of the <div></div> tags were replaced by the appropriate tabs. The section for <p></p> and <li></li> were condenced so the tags were on the same line. In the CSS file, the code was restructured into the respective selector classes and some of the tags with duplicate values were condenced.
